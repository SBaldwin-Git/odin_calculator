# The Odin Project

I created this project as part of The Odin Project Fullstack JavaScript course in order to continue to learn about storing and changing arrays of objects. I already have experience working with Objects due to my experience with Java, however it was interesting to learn about the different ways to implement and manage them.

My hope is that those that view this page and my other projects as part of this course can get an idea of my programming knowledge. These projects will help to catalogue my own journey into Fullstack JavaScript development.
